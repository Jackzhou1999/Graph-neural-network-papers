# Co-GCN for Multi-View Semi-Supervised Learning
* **Author**:Shu Li, Wen-Tao Li, Wei Wang∗
* **Abstract**:In many real-world applications, the data have several disjoint sets of features and each set is called as a view. Researchers have developed many multi-view learning methods in the past decade. In this paper, we bring Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) into multi-view learning and propose a novel multi-view semi-supervised learning method Co-GCN by adaptively exploiting the graph information from the multiple views with combined Laplacians. Experimental results on real-world data sets verify that Co-GCN can achieve better performance compared with state-of-the-art multi-view semi-supervised methods.
* **Summary**:In this paper, we propose Co-GCN for multi-view semi-supervised learning which unifies co-training, spectral graph information and the expressive power of neural network into one framework, in which we use combined Laplacian to exploit the graph information from the multiple views. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art multi-view semi-supervised learning, and also empirically show that the Co-GCN network in each view can adaptively learn the spectral information from other complementary views.
